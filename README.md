Tie-Subset
==========

This is the distribution of the Perl modules
[`Tie::Subset::Hash`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Tie::Subset::Hash) and
[`Tie::Subset::Array`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Tie::Subset::Array).

They are Perl extensions for `tie`-ing arrays and hashes to a
subset of another array or hash, respectively.

Please see the modules' documentation (POD) for details (try the
commands `perldoc lib/Tie/Subset/Hash.pm` and
`perldoc lib/Tie/Subset/Array.pm`) and the file `Changes` for
version information.
